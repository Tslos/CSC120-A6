- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

    Inheritance seems pretty straightforward conceptually, but hard to keep track of all the different methods. Thank god for VSCode smart suggestions! Really saved me a lot of scrolling around to remember what I called different methods / what the `Building` class could do. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    Worked: `Treemap` was really useful! I wanted to print the library inventory in alphabetical order to make it easier to read, and `Treemap` ended up being a pretty quick solution

    Didn't Work: Originally I was struggling with my `try` `catch` statements because I thought they used `()` nto `{}`. After I went back into the slides and found that syntax, things started getting much nicer. I was getting some really weird error messages before that though - VSCode would flag the line before the end of my `try` statements as if they were the problem, which it was actually how I closed them out that was the issue. 

    Advice: Start early! Lots of smaller parts and I think that If I had gotten stuck on some of the issues (like the `try` statements) closer to the deadline I would have been very stressed about it.
